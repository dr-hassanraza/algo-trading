    ‚Ä¢ High win rate (80%) - excellent performance
    ‚Ä¢ Simple implementation and maintenance
    ‚Ä¢ Good risk management practices
    ‚Ä¢ Suitable for PSX market conditions
    ‚Ä¢ Easy to understand and modify
    
    ‚ùå AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
    ‚Ä¢ Limited indicator diversity (only RSI, MACD, SMA)
    ‚Ä¢ No volume analysis (crucial for intraday)
    ‚Ä¢ No multi-timeframe confirmation
    ‚Ä¢ No machine learning adaptation
    ‚Ä¢ No sentiment analysis integration

    - Entry-level quantitative approaches
    
    üí∞ PROFIT POTENTIAL:
    - Good for consistent small profits (2-5% monthly)
    - Suitable for retail/small institutional capital
    - Risk-adjusted returns are solid but not exceptional
