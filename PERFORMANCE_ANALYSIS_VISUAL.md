## 📊 Metric Breakdown

### 1. Total Return Calculation
```
Time Period: Let's say your backtest ran from Jan 1 - Jun 30 (6 months)

Initial Capital:     1,000,000 PKR
Final Capital:         979,050 PKR  
Loss:                  -20,950 PKR

Total Return = (979,050 - 1,000,000) / 1,000,000 × 100 = -2.10%

⚠️ Important: This is NOT yearly return!
- If backtest = 6 months → -2.10% in 6 months
- If backtest = 1 year → -2.10% in 1 year  
- If backtest = 3 months → -2.10% in 3 months

To annualize: Yearly Return ≈ (Total Return / Days) × 365
```

### 2. Win Rate Reality Check
```
Total Trades: 10
Winning Trades: 0 ❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌
Losing Trades: 10

Win Rate = (0 wins / 10 trades) × 100 = 0.0%

💡 What this means:
- Your algorithm got EVERY SINGLE trade wrong
- This suggests fundamental signal problems
- Even random trading would give ~50% win rate
```

### 3. Profit Factor Explained  
```
Total Profits from Winning Trades: 0 PKR
Total Losses from Losing Trades: 20,950 PKR

Profit Factor = 0 ÷ 20,950 = 0.00

Interpretation:
- 0.00 = No profits generated
- 1.00 = Break-even (profits = losses)  
- 1.50 = Good (profits 1.5x losses)
- 2.00 = Excellent (profits 2x losses)
```

### 4. Max Drawdown Journey
```
Equity Curve Simulation:
1,000,000 → 995,000 → 990,000 → 985,000 → 977,000 → 982,000 → 979,050

Peak: 1,000,000 PKR (start)
Lowest Point: 977,000 PKR (worst moment)  
Drawdown: (1,000,000 - 977,000) / 1,000,000 = 2.3%

✅ Good News: 2.3% is low risk (under 10%)
❌ Bad News: Even with low risk, you still lost money
```

### 5. Sharpe Ratio Breakdown
```
Daily Returns: [-0.1%, -0.15%, +0.05%, -0.2%, -0.1%, ...]
Average Daily Return: -0.012% (negative!)
Standard Deviation: 0.8%

Sharpe = (-0.012% / 0.8%) × √252 = -2.71

Scale:
+3.0 = Exceptional
+2.0 = Excellent  
+1.0 = Good
 0.0 = Neutral
-1.0 = Poor
-2.71 = Very Poor ❌
```

## 🔧 Strategy Diagnosis

### What Went Wrong:
1. **Signal Timing**: Buying at wrong times (probably peaks)
2. **Exit Logic**: Selling at wrong times (probably dips) 
3. **Market Conditions**: HBL might be trending down
4. **Parameter Issues**: RSI/MA settings don't match HBL's behavior

### Quick Fix Ideas:
```python
# Current (broken) logic might be:
if rsi < 30:  # Buy on oversold
    buy()
if rsi > 70:  # Sell on overbought  
    sell()

# Try reverse or different thresholds:
if rsi < 25 and trend_up:  # More conservative
    buy()
if rsi > 75 or stop_loss_hit:  # Better exits
    sell()
```
